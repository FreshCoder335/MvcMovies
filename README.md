# Overview

When it comes to ASP.NET MVC. It is one of the most used applications for sotware use between client side and back end development. It is basically
a program that will showcase all aspects of the full round trip that data does. There is the input by the user, it sends that input through the internet to ping
the database, then it comes back and displays the input or added aspect to it. 

The purpose for creating this software is that of learning how data is handled through both the front end and back end development styles. This allowed me
to learn also how to create a web application that can ping a database hosted on my local host computer. In the real world the database would be hosted elsewhere
but this was simply for me to get an understanding of such things

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
